    description: [
      'We believe that as God’s creation we are first and foremost Worshipers. We do this by worshiping the Lord with all our mind, soul and might. We want our church to be theologically sounded, passionate in worship, and socially active in ministry.',
      'We want to love the Lord our God with all our mind. Christ has redeemed our minds, and so we want to use the mind that God have given us to reflect on him. We believe that part of worship is to rigorously contemplate on our God. Part of that is by learning rich doctrine and having a Christ centered understanding of the Bible, while avoiding cheap and simplistic theology.',
      'We want to love the Lord our God with all our soul. Part of being human is that we have emotions. We cry, we laugh, and we feel. We believe that God is to be praised with all of our emotions. Therefore we encourage to not hide your feelings, but to bring it to the family of God and share with each other. We are to love the Lord our God from the depth of our soul; with all that we have. Our energy is geared to praising God. We don’t want dead but live praise.',
      'We want to love the Lord our God with all of our might. We look at what God has done for us, and we can do nothing but be grateful. How do we show that we are grateful? We show that by being ethical, caring for the poor, and actively helping and waiting for the kingdom of God. We believe that though Christian worship is personal and communal; it is never private. We want to become effective for our community and a source of help for our neighborhoods.',
      'We pray that our worship and ministry is not just in one area, but a balanced, holistic worship: our (C4’s) whole lives offered to God.'

He not only became our perfect life and sacrificial death atoning the sins of all who will put their trust in Him, but He also resurrected from the dead; ascended into heaven; and is exalted as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Therefore we see him not only as Savior, but as our Lord.'

      'We believe that Adam was Humanity’s representation and being the first to sin we were all corrupted and blinded by Sin – helplessly sinful. None of our works are pure and pleasing to God. No one could save themselves, except through the mercy and grace of our Sovereign God.'
